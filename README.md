# Claude Code Multisession

**One prompt to control all your Claude Code sessions across every project.**

Stop switching terminals. Stop losing context. One session sees everything — your running agents, your costs, your work across every project — and routes new tasks to the right place automatically.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g lm-assist
```

The postinstall script automatically starts services, installs statusline, and this plugin.

**Open a new Claude Code session** and type `/sessions` to verify.

### Plugin Marketplace

Add the marketplace once — then install any combination of plugins:

```
/plugin marketplace add langmartai/lm-assist
```

| Install command | What you get |
|----------------|-------------|
| `/plugin install claude-code-multisession@langmartai` | Skills (observe, route) + commands (`/projects`, `/sessions`, `/summary`, `/run`) — cross-project session management |
| `/plugin install claude-code-webui@langmartai` | Skill (dashboard) + commands (`/web`, `/web-sessions`, `/web-tasks`) — web dashboard access |
| `/plugin install lm-assist@langmartai` | Commands (`/assist`, `/assist-setup`, `/assist-status`, `/assist-search`, `/assist-logs`) — setup and diagnostics |

Install all three for the full experience, or pick what you need.

## What It Does

You're working on Project A. You say "fix the auth bug in Project B." Claude Code Multisession:

1. Checks your current session — is this about Project A? No.
2. Finds Project B's sessions — is there one that already worked on auth? Yes.
3. Checks if it's running:
   - **Running** → queues your prompt. When it finishes, your auth fix runs next with full context.
   - **Idle** → resumes that session with your prompt. It picks up right where it left off.
   - **No relevant session** → creates a new execution on Project B and runs your prompt there.

You never left Project A. You never opened another terminal.

## Four Commands

### `/projects` — All your projects at a glance

```
Projects (4)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Project                    Sessions      Cost  Summary
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * my-backend                       42    $67.70  Node.js REST API with Express, PostgreSQL
   my-frontend                      28    $34.20  React dashboard with TypeScript
   my-infra                         15    $12.40  Terraform + CI/CD pipeline
   my-shared-lib                     8     $5.10  Shared utility packages
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Total                            93   $119.40

 * = current project
```

### `/sessions` — See everything

```
Sessions (3 running, 127 total)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status  Name                 Project        Cost   Turns
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[RUN]   api-refactor         my-backend     $45.20   312
[RUN]   dashboard-redesign   my-frontend    $23.10   185
        auth-module-review   my-backend     $12.50    95
        deploy-pipeline      my-infra        $8.30    42
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total cost: $89.10
```

All projects. All sessions. Running status. Costs. One view.

### `/summary` — Know what this session is doing

```
Session Summary
═══════════════
Name:    api-refactor
Project: my-backend
Turns:   312 | Cost: $45.20
Status:  in progress

What this session is about:
  Refactoring the REST API to use dependency injection.

What was accomplished:
  • Migrated 12 route files to new pattern
  • Added integration tests for auth endpoints
  • Fixed 3 circular dependency issues

Current state:
  Working on the database layer refactor.
```

The summary is the anchor. When you say something, Claude Code Multisession checks: does this belong here? If yes — just do it. If no — route it.

### `/run <prompt>` — Execute anywhere

```
> /run review the frontend components for accessibility

Checking running executions...
  dashboard-redesign is running on my-frontend (T:185, $23.10)

Recommendation: QUEUE
  This session is already working on the frontend.
  Queued as normal priority. Will process when current work completes.
```

## How Routing Works

You don't configure routing. It learns.

**First time** you mention "database migration":
```
Checking project summaries... → found in my-backend
Checking session summaries... → found auth-module-review session
4 API calls to route.
```

**Second time** you mention "database migration":
```
Learning signal: database migration → my-backend (2x)
1 API call. Instant route.
```

**After a week**, most of your vocabulary is mapped. Routing is instant for everything you regularly work on.

### The Decision Flow

| Your prompt | Current project | What happens |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| "fix the build error" | my-backend | **STAY** — clearly about this project |
| "update the login page" | my-backend | **ROUTE** → my-frontend, resume dashboard-redesign |
| "check if prod is healthy" | any | **LOCAL** — simple curl/ssh, no switch needed |
| "add rate limiting to the API" | my-frontend | **ROUTE** → my-backend, find relevant session |
| "deploy the latest changes" | my-backend | **RESUME** → deploy-pipeline session |
| "refactor the auth module" | my-backend | **STAY** — same project, auth-module-review session |

### What Happens When Sessions Are Busy

If the target session is running:

```
dashboard-redesign is running (T:185, $23.10, 12m elapsed)

Your prompt has been queued:
  [normal] review frontend components for accessibility
  Context: The session is currently redesigning the dashboard layout.
           After that completes, it should review all new components
           for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

Queue for dashboard-redesign (2 pending):
  [high]   fix the responsive breakpoint on mobile
  [normal] review frontend components for accessibility
```

Queued prompts include:
- **Original intent** — what you said
- **Formatted prompt** — expanded into actionable instructions
- **Context hint** — what the session should know before starting
- **Priority** — high/normal/low (high processes first)
- **Source** — which session/project queued it

## Session Intelligence

Claude Code Multisession gets smarter the more you use it.

### Session Summaries

Every session gets an LLM-generated summary describing what it does, what was accomplished, and its current state. Summaries update incrementally — only new turns are read.

```
api-refactor (312 turns):
  Refactoring REST API to dependency injection pattern. 12 route files
  migrated. Integration tests added. Working on database layer.

dashboard-redesign (185 turns):
  Redesigning frontend dashboard with new component library. Header
  and sidebar complete. Working on data visualization panels.
```

### Project Summaries

Each project gets a comprehensive reference generated by an agent that explores the actual codebase — not just CLAUDE.md but scripts, configs, package.json, deployment files.

```
my-backend:
  Node.js REST API with Express, PostgreSQL, Redis.
  Services: npm start (port 3000), npm test
  Deploy: docker-compose up, CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  Areas: auth, billing, users, notifications
```

### Auto-Learning

Keywords, commands, and routing patterns accumulate with frequency counts:

```
my-backend:
  Frequently mentioned: database migration(5x), auth module(3x), rate limiting(2x)
  Commands used: npm test(8x), docker-compose up(3x)
  Routing: "auth" → api-refactor session, "deploy" → deploy-pipeline session
```

After enough interactions, routing skips the deep scan entirely — signals already know the answer.
